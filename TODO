=head2 Stuff to fix

* make sure in Build.PL that the GSL include files are where we think they
  are, so that the compilation doesn't blowup when people have put there
  headers in a non-standard place

* make sure blib/ files are copied to correct place in lib/

* make the interface files not be hardcoded to /usr/local/include/gsl, possibly
  using an environment variable
